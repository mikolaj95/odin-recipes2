        <p>Description</p>
        <p>This salted caramel apple pie has everything you'd want out of an apple pie</p>
        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>granny Smith apples</li>
            <li>white sugar</li>
            <li>all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>lemon juice</li>
            <li>cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Directions</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the dough: Whisk the flour and salt, then work in the butter. Stir in the water.
                Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead until it's smooth.
                Divide the dough into two discs, wrap in storage wrap, and chill each half in plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>Make the sauce: Heat the sugar until it's melted and amber in color.
                Add the butter, then add the cream. Remove from the heat and add the salt. Let cool.</li>
            <li>Make the filling: Stir the filling ingredients until well-combined.
                Let it sit for about 30 minutes, then pour it through a strainer into a large bowl.
                Thicken the liquid on the stove.
                Allow the liquid to cool to room temperature, then stir it into the apple mixture.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough: Turn each dough disc out onto a lightly floured surface.
                Roll them out into 12-inch circles.</li>
            <li>Assemble the pie: Press one of the dough halves into a pie pan.
                Add the filling, then top with Â½ of the caramel sauce.
                Place the remaining dough circle over top and crimp the edge.
                Brush the top with a beaten egg, sprinkle with turbinado sugar,
                and cut slits into the dough with a sharp knife.</li>
            <li>Bake the pie: Place the pie on a baking sheet.
                Bake at 400 degrees F until the top is light golden brown,
                then reduce the heat to 375 degrees and continue baking until the top is a deep golden brown.
                Serve with the remaining caramel sauce.</li>
        </ol>
