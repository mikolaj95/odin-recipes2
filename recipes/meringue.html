        <p>Description</p>
        <p>While I know no one is ever actually scared by spooky Halloween treats,
            I do know for a fact that many people are terrified to work with meringue.
            Hopefully these bones and ghosts will help chase those demons away.

        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large egg whites</li>
            <li>2 drops fresh lemon juice, or more to taste</li>
            <li>7 tablespoons white sugar, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 chocolate chips, melted, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Directions</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).
                 Line 2 baking sheets with silicone baking mats.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs whites and lemon juice together in a bowl until thick,
                 white, and foamy. Add sugar a spoonful at a time, whisking constantly,
                  until meringue is shiny, thick, and holds its shape.</li>
            <li>Transfer meringue to a piping bag. Pipe 12 bone shapes onto a prepared baking sheet.
                 Pipe 12 puffs to resemble ghosts onto the remaining baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until dried and firm, about 1 hour.
                 Turn off the oven, close the door, and cool until completely dried, about 1 hour more.</li>
            <li>Dip the tip of a toothpick into melted chocolate and dot chocolate "eyes" on each of the ghosts.</li>
        </ol>
